- send otps - AWS SNS?
- set otp expiry time to 5mins
- What if a customer wants to be a helper as well, not everyone can have 2 mobile numbers
- replace friend with helper after deciding with Pinks
- footer with circle needs upgrade, not looking good on desktop
- otp when regenerated, show a message saying OTP resent to your mobbile
- when offline? 
will it work
if not, show a alert that you're offline
- app notifications - not otp or alets
- skeleton loading
- move bulk imports in head to new file - but differnt hbs will have different imports - check!
- split index.js into files
- check helperAuth works or not
- website to app
- restrict API key to website and API calls - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdDXbvBFXLY
- autocomplete places
- current location as map center
- set location by picking on map instead of typing text
- Pinks to add back arrow button
- groceries from a fixed shop? dmart eg
- some helper verification - even if they fly away stealing, we can catch them. How? Aadhaar? Driving's License?
- Pinks: Check the flow 
    - location screen show/hide
        - From & To
        - Only To

- allow multiple photo upload
- don't allow going back in few situations
- unknown items - cal option and ask for price too
- if has to come to from and go to to and come back to from (xerox) - charge extra for first trip to from
    - for that, do: cost = from->to + to->from 
    - and not just to->from
- note time for time based ones - dog walking, waiting in queue
- ask tutors to give price/time inputs beforehand and customers can choose one
- check if this causes an issue - 
        removing in signup.hbs

                    document.getElementById("input1").focus();
                }
